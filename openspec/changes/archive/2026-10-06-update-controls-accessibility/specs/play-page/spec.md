## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Confirmation before discarding player entries

«Нова головоломка», a press of a size button of another size and «Скинути» SHALL ask for confirmation only when the board has player entries (FR-67). A player entry is a non-given cell that is not empty; a cell filled by a hint counts as one (A-8); a board that was just solved has entries, so the confirmation is also asked after a win (A-29). The confirmation SHALL be a native `<dialog>` `[data-dialog="confirm"]`, created once at mount inside the page root, outside the board element and outside the sequence of «Page document order» (it follows the rules panel), closed at mount, and opened with `showModal()`. It SHALL hold the text «Почати заново? Ваші ходи на цьому полі буде втрачено.» and exactly two `<button type="button">`: `[data-confirm="yes"]` with the text «Так, почати» and `[data-confirm="no"]` with the text «Скасувати». «Так, почати» SHALL close the dialog (calling `close()`) and then perform the pending action exactly as it would on an untouched board. «Скасувати», and Escape (the dialog's `cancel` and `close` events with no button pressed), SHALL close the dialog and leave unchanged the board, the size (`aria-checked`), the hint message, the win message, the highlights and `cell-hinted`; no seed is taken and the generator is not called. A cancelled action is dropped: it is never performed later. On a board with no player entries the action happens at once and `showModal()` is never called. Reading rule: wherever another requirement of this capability says that pressing «Нова головоломка», changing the size or pressing «Скинути» has an effect (for example «Highlighting follows every board change», «Hint message stays until the next hint or a new puzzle» and the size steps of «Board rendering and default size»), the effect happens when the action is performed: at once on a board without player entries, after «Так, почати» on a board with entries; a requested but unperformed action has no effect. The dialog SHALL have `aria-labelledby` naming the `id` of the element that holds its text (unique per mount), so assistive technology announces the question (A-20). When the page opens the dialog it SHALL move focus to «Скасувати» (after `showModal()`), so that the safe choice is the default and two key presses cannot discard the player's moves (A-20; the user's decision of 2026-10-06, review round 1). Where the dialog is drawn and its focus ring are layout and are covered by the held NFR-13 and NFR-14, see `docs/requirements-held.md`.

Traces: FR-67, FR-42, FR-43, FR-58, FR-66

#### Scenario: The dialog at mount

- **GIVEN** the page has just been mounted
- **WHEN** the test reads `[data-dialog="confirm"]`
- **THEN** exactly one such `dialog` element exists in the root, it has no `open` attribute, it is not inside `[data-board]` or the header or the message area, and it follows the rules panel in document order
- **AND** its text includes «Почати заново? Ваші ходи на цьому полі буде втрачено.»
- **AND** it contains exactly two `button` elements of `type="button"`: `[data-confirm="yes"]` with the text «Так, почати» and `[data-confirm="no"]` with the text «Скасувати»
- **AND** the `showModal` spy has not been called

#### Scenario: The dialog is named by its question and opens on «Скасувати»

- **GIVEN** a mounted page with a fixture puzzle on which the player has clicked one non-given cell
- **WHEN** the test reads the dialog, and then the player presses «Нова головоломка»
- **THEN** the dialog's `aria-labelledby` names an element inside the dialog whose text is «Почати заново? Ваші ходи на цьому полі буде втрачено.», and two mounts give two different ids
- **AND** after the press the dialog is open and the focused element of the document is `[data-confirm="no"]`

#### Scenario: No player entries means no dialog

- **GIVEN** a mounted 6x6 fixture board with no player entries (only givens), the `showModal` and `close` methods of `HTMLDialogElement.prototype` installed as spies that set and remove the `open` attribute (jsdom has neither), and a counting seed source and a `generate` spy
- **WHEN** the player does each of the actions in this table, each from a freshly mounted page

| Action | Expected effect at once |
|--------|-------------------------|
| presses «Нова головоломка» | a new puzzle of size 6 from the next seed |
| presses the button «Поле 4×4» | a 4x4 board from the next seed, `aria-checked="true"` on «Поле 4×4» |
| presses «Скинути» | no cell, class or message changes |

- **THEN** the `showModal` spy was never called, the dialog has no `open` attribute, and the expected effect of the row happened

#### Scenario: A board with entries asks first and changes nothing yet

- **GIVEN** a mounted 6x6 fixture board on which the player has clicked one non-given cell to `1`, has pressed «Підказка» so that a hint filled another cell (`cell-hinted`) and a hint sentence is shown, with cells carrying `cell-violation`, and a counting seed source and a `generate` spy whose counts are read now
- **WHEN** the player does each of the actions in this table, each from a freshly prepared page

| Action |
|--------|
| presses «Нова головоломка» |
| presses the button «Поле 8×8» (the injected generator returns an 8x8 fixture) |
| presses «Скинути» |

- **THEN** `showModal` was called exactly once and the dialog has the `open` attribute
- **AND** every cell keeps its text, `[data-board]` keeps `data-size="6"`, `aria-checked="true"` stays on «Поле 6×6», `[data-message="hint"]` and `[data-message="win"]` keep their text, the set of `cell-violation` cells and the `cell-hinted` cell are unchanged
- **AND** the seed-source call count and the generator call count equal the counts read before the press

#### Scenario: «Так, почати» closes the dialog and then performs the action

- **GIVEN** the page of the previous scenario with the dialog open for each action of the table
- **WHEN** the player presses `[data-confirm="yes"]`

| Action pending | Expected effect |
|----------------|-----------------|
| «Нова головоломка» | a 6x6 board generated from the next seed (one seed taken, one generator call), no player entries |
| «Поле 8×8» | an 8x8 board (`data-size="8"`, 64 cells), `aria-checked="true"` on «Поле 8×8» only, one seed taken |
| «Скинути» | every non-given cell empty, every given kept, `data-size="6"`, no seed taken, no generator call |

- **THEN** the `close` spy was called once and the dialog has no `open` attribute
- **AND** the expected effect of the row happened, `[data-message="hint"]` and `[data-message="win"]` have empty text content, no cell has `cell-hinted`, and the `cell-violation` cells are exactly those the rule checker reports for the board shown

#### Scenario: «Скасувати» leaves everything unchanged

- **GIVEN** the page of the scenario «A board with entries asks first and changes nothing yet» with the dialog open for each action of that table
- **WHEN** the player presses `[data-confirm="no"]`
- **THEN** the `close` spy was called once and the dialog has no `open` attribute
- **AND** every cell keeps its text, `[data-board]` keeps `data-size="6"`, `aria-checked="true"` stays on «Поле 6×6», both messages keep their text, the set of `cell-violation` cells and the `cell-hinted` cell are unchanged
- **AND** the seed-source call count and the generator call count equal the counts read before the press, and `showModal` was called exactly once in all

#### Scenario: Escape leaves everything unchanged and drops the action

- **GIVEN** the page of the previous scenario with the dialog open after pressing «Нова головоломка»
- **WHEN** the test dispatches a `cancel` event and then a `close` event on the dialog (what a browser does for Escape), pressing no button
- **THEN** the board, the size, the messages, the highlights and `cell-hinted` are unchanged, and neither the seed source nor the generator was called again
- **AND** pressing «Нова головоломка» again opens the dialog a second time (`showModal` called twice in all) and pressing `[data-confirm="yes"]` then performs exactly one new puzzle (one seed taken)

#### Scenario: A hint-filled cell counts as a player entry

- **GIVEN** a mounted fixture board on which the player has only pressed «Підказка» once, so the one non-empty non-given cell was filled by the hint
- **WHEN** the player presses «Нова головоломка»
- **THEN** `showModal` was called once and the board is unchanged until `[data-confirm="yes"]` is pressed

#### Scenario: A solved board still asks (A-29)

- **GIVEN** a fixture puzzle whose solution the test knows, solved by clicks so that the win message is shown
- **WHEN** the player presses «Скинути», and in separate runs «Нова головоломка» and the button of another size
- **THEN** each time `showModal` was called once, and the board and the win message are unchanged until `[data-confirm="yes"]` is pressed

#### Scenario: Entries that were cleared again do not count

- **GIVEN** a mounted fixture board on which the player clicked a non-given cell three times (it shows empty again) and clicked a given cell
- **WHEN** the player presses «Нова головоломка»
- **THEN** `showModal` was never called and a new puzzle was generated at once

### Requirement: Pressing the shown size changes nothing

Pressing the size button of the size already shown SHALL be a no-op (FR-73): no dialog, no new puzzle, no seed taken, no generator call, and the board, both messages, the highlights, `aria-checked` and `cell-hinted` unchanged (FR-66). This holds on a board with player entries and on a board without. When no board is shown (the generation at mount failed), the no-op rule does not apply: «Поле 6×6» keeps `aria-checked="true"` from mount (see «Grid size selector»), and a press of any size button, «Поле 6×6» included, generates a board of that size at once (there are no entries to confirm).

Traces: FR-73, FR-66, FR-43

#### Scenario: The shown size is a no-op at every size

- **GIVEN** a mounted page showing a board of size N from the table below (reached by pressing the size button when N is not 6, with the injected generator returning a fixture of size N), on which the player has made entries, pressed «Підказка» (a hint sentence is shown, one cell has `cell-hinted`) and made some cells carry `cell-violation`, with a counting seed source and a `generate` spy and the `showModal` spy

| N | Button pressed |
|---|----------------|
| 4 | «Поле 4×4» |
| 6 | «Поле 6×6» |
| 8 | «Поле 8×8» |

- **WHEN** the player presses the button of the row (the size already shown), and again on a freshly mounted page of the same size with no player entries
- **THEN** `showModal` was never called, the seed-source and generator call counts are unchanged, every cell keeps its text and class list (including `cell-violation` and `cell-hinted`), both messages keep their text, and `aria-checked="true"` stays on that button only

#### Scenario: With no board shown, a size button generates

- **GIVEN** a page whose generation at mount threw, so no board is shown, and a generator that succeeds afterwards
- **WHEN** the player presses «Поле 6×6»
- **THEN** no dialog opens, one seed is taken and the generator is called once with size 6, and a 6×6 board is shown with `aria-checked="true"` on «Поле 6×6»

### Requirement: Cells are buttons

Every board cell `[data-cell]` SHALL be a `<button type="button">`, reachable by Tab in reading order and activated by Enter and Space as a native button (FR-69, A-20). A given cell SHALL be a button with `aria-disabled="true"` and without the `disabled` attribute, so it stays focusable and readable; a click on it changes nothing (FR-33). A non-given cell SHALL have neither `disabled` nor `aria-disabled="true"`. No cell, no size button, no action button and no rules button SHALL carry a negative `tabindex`, so Tab reaches each of them (A-24). Cells are in the document in reading order (row by row, left to right). Enter and Space are the native activation of a button and are not re-implemented by the page; jsdom does not turn a keydown into a click, so these two keys are covered by the element type and attributes, and real focus and keyboard behaviour are covered by the held NFR-13, see `docs/requirements-held.md`. Arrow keys are not required (A-24) and are not specified.

Traces: FR-69

#### Scenario: Every cell is a native button at each size

- **GIVEN** a mounted page showing a board of size N from the table below, with a fixture puzzle that has at least one given

| N |
|---|
| 4 |
| 6 |
| 8 |

- **WHEN** the test reads every `[data-cell]`
- **THEN** there are N×N of them, each is a `button` element with `type="button"`, and none has a `tabindex` attribute with a negative value
- **AND** in document order their (`data-row`, `data-col`) pairs run row by row and left to right, from (1, 1) to (N, N)

#### Scenario: Givens are aria-disabled, not disabled

- **GIVEN** a mounted fixture board with givens and non-given cells
- **WHEN** the test reads the attributes of every cell
- **THEN** every cell with `data-given="true"` has `aria-disabled="true"` and no `disabled` attribute
- **AND** every cell with `data-given="false"` has no `disabled` attribute and no `aria-disabled="true"`

#### Scenario: The controls are in the tab order

- **GIVEN** the page has just been mounted
- **WHEN** the test reads the `tabindex` and `disabled` attributes of the three size buttons, `[data-action="hint"]`, `[data-action="reset"]`, `[data-action="new"]` and `[data-action="rules"]`
- **THEN** each is a `button` element, none has the `disabled` attribute, and none has a negative `tabindex`

### Requirement: Cell labels

Every cell SHALL have an `aria-label` in Ukrainian of the form «Рядок R, стовпець C, V» followed by an optional suffix, where R and C are the 1-based row and column and V is «порожньо» for an empty cell, «0» for a zero and «1» for a one (FR-70). A given cell appends «, задано»; the cell that a hint filled (FR-66) appends «, підказка»; any other cell has no suffix, and a cell does not get a suffix for being in violation. The label SHALL be updated after every change of the cell (a click, a hint, reset, a new puzzle, a size change). A label contains no Latin letters (NFR-5).

Traces: FR-70, FR-66, NFR-5

#### Scenario: The four label forms

- **GIVEN** a mounted 6x6 fixture board whose givens are `1` at (1, 4), `0` at (5, 3), `1` at (5, 4) and `1` at (5, 5), so that the hint engine returns row 5, column 6, value 0 (the pair rule)
- **WHEN** the player presses «Підказка», and the test reads the labels of the cells (3, 2), (1, 4) and (5, 6), after clicking (3, 2) once for the digit form
- **THEN** the label of (3, 2) before the click is «Рядок 3, стовпець 2, порожньо» and after one click is «Рядок 3, стовпець 2, 0»
- **AND** the label of (1, 4) is «Рядок 1, стовпець 4, 1, задано»
- **AND** the label of (5, 6) is «Рядок 5, стовпець 6, 0, підказка»

#### Scenario: Labels follow every change of the cell

- **GIVEN** a mounted fixture board and a non-given cell (R, C) that is empty
- **WHEN** the player clicks it three times, one click at a time
- **THEN** its label reads «…, 0», «…, 1» and «…, порожньо» in turn, with the same R and C each time
- **AND** after a hint has filled a cell its label gains «, підказка», and after a click on that cell the suffix is gone and the digit has moved on in the cycle
- **AND** after «Скинути» (confirmed when entries exist) every non-given cell reads «…, порожньо» and every given keeps its «, задано» label

#### Scenario: A violation adds no suffix

- **GIVEN** a mounted fixture board on which the player made three equal digits side by side in a row of non-given cells, so the three cells carry `cell-violation`
- **WHEN** the test reads their labels
- **THEN** each label is «Рядок R, стовпець C, V» with V the digit and nothing after it
- **AND** a given cell that is part of a violation keeps exactly the suffix «, задано»

#### Scenario: Labels use the size of the board

- **GIVEN** a mounted page showing a board of size N from the table below, with a fixture puzzle

| N | Label of the last cell when it is an empty non-given cell |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 4 | Рядок 4, стовпець 4, порожньо |
| 6 | Рядок 6, стовпець 6, порожньо |
| 8 | Рядок 8, стовпець 8, порожньо |

- **WHEN** the test reads the `aria-label` of the cell at `data-row` N and `data-col` N
- **THEN** it equals the label of the row of the table

### Requirement: Ukrainian texts of the confirmation dialog, size control and cell labels

Every text that the confirmation dialog, the size control and the cells expose SHALL be Ukrainian: it contains Cyrillic letters and no Latin letters (NFR-5). This covers the group name «Розмір поля», the labels «Поле 4×4», «Поле 6×6» and «Поле 8×8», the confirmation text «Почати заново? Ваші ходи на цьому полі буде втрачено.», «Так, почати», «Скасувати», every cell label of «Cell labels», and any `aria-label`, `title`, `alt` or `label` attribute among them. Digits, «×» and the cell digits are not Latin letters. By the user's code-organisation decision of 2026-10-05 (not a requirement) these texts are kept in `src/ui/strings.ts`, the single module created by `update-page-layout`; the source scan of «Ukrainian texts of the header, rules panel and idle line» guards it.

Traces: NFR-5, FR-43, FR-67, FR-70

#### Scenario: The new texts are Ukrainian

- **GIVEN** the page has just been mounted
- **WHEN** the test collects the text nodes of the size control, of the confirmation dialog, the `aria-label` of the size control and of every `[data-cell]`, and every `title`, `alt` and `label` attribute inside them
- **THEN** the collection contains «Розмір поля», «Поле 4×4», «Поле 6×6», «Поле 8×8», «Почати заново? Ваші ходи на цьому полі буде втрачено.», «Так, почати» and «Скасувати»
- **AND** every collected text matches `/\p{Script=Cyrillic}/u` and none matches `/[A-Za-z]/`
- **AND** the source scan of `update-page-layout` (no Cyrillic outside `src/ui/strings.ts`) still finds nothing

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Grid size selector

The page SHALL offer a size control `[data-control="size"]`, a segmented control: an element with `role="radiogroup"` and the accessible name «Розмір поля» (`aria-label`), holding exactly three `<button type="button" role="radio">` elements labelled «Поле 4×4», «Поле 6×6» and «Поле 8×8» (sizes 4, 6, 8, in this order) (FR-43, A-24). The button of the size of the board shown SHALL have `aria-checked="true"` and the other two `aria-checked="false"`; 6×6 is selected when the page is mounted. One press of a button of another size SHALL start a new puzzle of that size from a new seed taken from the seed source (one seed per generation attempt), render a board of that size, and clear the hint message, the win message, all highlights that belonged to the old board and the `cell-hinted` marker; when the board has player entries the page SHALL first ask for confirmation (FR-67) and start the new puzzle only after «Так, почати». Until the confirmation, and after «Скасувати», `aria-checked` stays on the size of the board shown. The page assumes that `generate(n, seed)` returns an n×n puzzle: if the generator throws, or the returned `puzzle.givens` is not n rows of n cells, the page SHALL treat it as a generator failure and keep the previous board, the previous messages and highlights, `cell-hinted` and the previous size, and `aria-checked` SHALL stay on the size of the board that is shown, with no uncaught error. The page reads a size only from the three buttons, never from a free value: the behaviour «a changed value that is not exactly 4, 6 or 8 is ignored» of the earlier select-based control is REMOVED, because with three fixed buttons no free value can be submitted; the invariant that exactly three sizes exist is carried by «exactly three buttons». Pressing the button of the size already shown is specified by «Pressing the shown size changes nothing». Rules, hint and win message work at the chosen size exactly as at 6. The page MUST NOT remember the choice: a reload or a new mount starts at 6 (TC-12).

Traces: FR-43, FR-67, FR-66

#### Scenario: Size control structure and default

- **GIVEN** the page has just been mounted
- **WHEN** the test reads `[data-control="size"]`
- **THEN** it has `role="radiogroup"` and `aria-label` equal to «Розмір поля», and it contains exactly three `button` elements, each with `type="button"` and `role="radio"`, whose texts are «Поле 4×4», «Поле 6×6» and «Поле 8×8», in this order
- **AND** the second button has `aria-checked="true"` and the other two have `aria-checked="false"`

#### Scenario: Size buttons are native buttons in the tab order

- **GIVEN** the page has just been mounted
- **WHEN** the test reads the three size buttons
- **THEN** none has the `disabled` attribute and none has a negative `tabindex`, so Tab reaches each one, and a click on each (the activation that Enter and Space perform on a native button) selects its size (arrow keys are not required, A-24)

#### Scenario: Choose 4x4 on a board without entries

- **GIVEN** the default 6x6 board with no player entries, a seed source returning 1 and then 2, and the real engine generator
- **WHEN** the player presses the button «Поле 4×4»
- **THEN** `[data-board]` has `data-size="4"` and contains exactly 16 `[data-cell]` elements with `data-row` and `data-col` values 1 to 4, each pair appearing exactly once
- **AND** for every cell, `data-given="true"` holds exactly where the generator returns a given for size 4 and seed 2, and each given cell shows the digit the generator returns for it
- **AND** `aria-checked="true"` is on «Поле 4×4» only

#### Scenario: Choose 8x8 after play

- **GIVEN** a 6x6 fixture board with player entries, a hint sentence shown, a hint-filled cell with `cell-hinted` and some cells with `cell-violation`, and an injected `generate` that returns an 8x8 fixture puzzle for size 8
- **WHEN** the player presses «Поле 8×8», and then presses `[data-confirm="yes"]`
- **THEN** after the first press the dialog is open and the board is still 6x6 with `aria-checked="true"` on «Поле 6×6»
- **AND** after the confirmation `[data-board]` has `data-size="8"` and contains exactly 64 `[data-cell]` elements with no player entries (a non-given cell shows empty text), and `aria-checked="true"` is on «Поле 8×8» only
- **AND** `[data-message="hint"]` has empty text content and no cell has `cell-hinted`
- **AND** the cells of the new board carry `cell-violation` only where the rule checker reports a violation for the new puzzle's givens

#### Scenario: Choose 8x8 after a win

- **GIVEN** a 6x6 fixture board on which the win message is shown (the board is solved, so no cell has `cell-violation`), and an injected `generate` that returns an 8x8 fixture puzzle for size 8
- **WHEN** the player presses «Поле 8×8» and then `[data-confirm="yes"]` (a solved board has entries, A-29)
- **THEN** `[data-message="win"]` has empty text content and `[data-board]` has `data-size="8"` and 64 cells

#### Scenario: Going back to 6x6

- **GIVEN** the page shows an 8×8 board reached by pressing «Поле 8×8» on an untouched 6x6 board
- **WHEN** the player presses «Поле 6×6»
- **THEN** `[data-board]` has `data-size="6"` and contains exactly 36 cells, and `aria-checked="true"` is on «Поле 6×6» only

#### Scenario: aria-checked stays on the shown size until the confirmation

- **GIVEN** a 6x6 board with player entries
- **WHEN** the player presses «Поле 4×4», the test reads the buttons, and then presses `[data-confirm="no"]` and reads them again
- **THEN** both times `aria-checked="true"` is on «Поле 6×6» only and the board is still 6x6

#### Scenario: A change takes exactly one seed and passes the chosen size

- **GIVEN** a seed source returning 1, 2, 3 and so on, counting its calls, and a `generate` spy recording `(size, seed)`
- **WHEN** the page is mounted, then the player presses «Поле 4×4», then «Поле 8×8» (each board has no player entries)
- **THEN** the spy recorded `(6, 1)`, `(4, 2)` and `(8, 3)` in this order and the seed source was called exactly three times

#### Scenario: A generator error keeps the previous board

- **GIVEN** a 6x6 fixture board with player entries, a hint sentence shown and a hint-filled cell, a counting seed source, a `window` `error` listener, and an injected `generate` that throws for size 8
- **WHEN** the player presses «Поле 8×8» and then `[data-confirm="yes"]`
- **THEN** the `error` listener recorded nothing, `[data-board]` keeps `data-size="6"` with the same cell texts and highlights, both message regions keep their text, and the hint-filled cell keeps `cell-hinted`
- **AND** `aria-checked="true"` is on «Поле 6×6» only and the dialog is closed
- **AND** the seed source was called exactly once for the failed change (one seed per generation attempt)

#### Scenario: A generator result of the wrong size keeps the previous board

- **GIVEN** a 6x6 fixture board with player entries and a hint sentence shown, and an injected `generate` that returns a 6x6 fixture puzzle for size 8
- **WHEN** the player presses «Поле 8×8» and then `[data-confirm="yes"]`
- **THEN** `[data-board]` keeps `data-size="6"` with 36 cells and the same cell texts, both message regions keep their text, and `aria-checked="true"` is on «Поле 6×6» only

#### Scenario: Hint and win at the chosen size

- **GIVEN** the player has pressed the size button of the row below on an untouched 6x6 board, and the injected `generate` returned the fixture of that row

| N | Fixture | Hint action | Expected hint | Win action |
|---|---------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| 4 | only givens `0` at `data-row` 2 with `data-col` 1 and 2 | press `[data-action="hint"]` | engine returns `{ kind: 'fill', row: 1, col: 2, value: 1, rule: 'pair' }`: cell `data-row="2"` `data-col="3"` shows `1` | a second fixture of size 4 with an explicit solution whose givens are every cell except one non-given cell: click that cell until it shows the solution digit |
| 8 | only givens `0` at `data-row` 8 with `data-col` 7 and 8 | press `[data-action="hint"]` | engine returns `{ kind: 'fill', row: 7, col: 5, value: 1, rule: 'pair' }`: cell `data-row="8"` `data-col="6"` shows `1` | a second fixture of size 8 with an explicit solution (a valid solved 8x8 grid written in the test) whose givens are every cell except the one at `data-row` 8 and `data-col` 8: click it until it shows the solution digit |

- **WHEN** the player does the hint action, and on the second fixture the win action
- **THEN** after the hint action the expected cell shows `1`, has `cell-hinted`, every other cell has the same text as before, and `[data-message="hint"]` shows the engine's sentence
- **AND** after the win action `[data-message="win"]` shows the win message required by «Win message when solved»

#### Scenario: Violations in the givens of a new board show at once

- **GIVEN** a 6x6 board with no player entries and an injected `generate` that returns, for size 8, the fixture of the row below

| Fixture (8x8, only these givens) | Cells that have `cell-violation` right after the change |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `0` at `data-row` 8 with `data-col` 1, 2 and 3 (an inconsistent fixture) | exactly (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3) |
| `1` at `data-col` 8 with `data-row` 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 (five `1` in the column, no three side by side) | all eight cells with `data-col="8"` and no cell outside that column |

- **WHEN** the player presses «Поле 8×8» and does nothing else
- **THEN** the cells with `cell-violation` are exactly those of the row

#### Scenario: The choice is not remembered

- **GIVEN** a page on which the player pressed «Поле 8×8», and `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` empty before the test
- **WHEN** the page is mounted again on a new root
- **THEN** the new page's `aria-checked="true"` is on «Поле 6×6» only and its `[data-board]` has `data-size="6"` and 36 cells
- **AND** `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` still hold no entry

### Requirement: New puzzle button

The page SHALL, when the «Нова головоломка» button is pressed on a board without player entries, replace the board at once with a puzzle generated for the currently shown size from a new seed; when the board has player entries it SHALL first ask for confirmation (FR-67) and replace the board only after «Так, почати». Replacing the board SHALL clear the hint message, the win message, all highlights that belonged to the old board and the `cell-hinted` marker (FR-42, FR-66). The size control keeps its state: `aria-checked` stays on the size of the board shown. The page MUST NOT require the new puzzle to differ from the old one.

Traces: FR-42, FR-43, FR-67, FR-66

#### Scenario: New puzzle after play

- **GIVEN** a 6x6 board with player entries, a hint sentence shown and the win message shown, and the injected seed source returning 7 for the next call
- **WHEN** the player presses `[data-action="new"]`, and then `[data-confirm="yes"]`
- **THEN** the board has 36 cells matching what the page's generator returns for size 6 and seed 7 (with an injected `generate` that returns the fixture for the first call and the engine generator's output afterwards), with no player entries
- **AND** `[data-message="hint"]` and `[data-message="win"]` both have empty text content

#### Scenario: New puzzle on a board without entries acts at once

- **GIVEN** a 6x6 fixture board with no player entries, and a counting seed source
- **WHEN** the player presses `[data-action="new"]`
- **THEN** no dialog was opened (`showModal` never called) and one seed was taken for a new board

#### Scenario: New puzzle keeps the chosen size

- **GIVEN** the player has pressed «Поле 8×8», the board is 8×8, and a `generate` spy records `(size, seed)`
- **WHEN** the player presses the new puzzle button (the board has no entries, so at once)
- **THEN** the board has `data-size="8"` and 64 cells, `aria-checked="true"` is still on «Поле 8×8» only, and the spy's last call has size 8

#### Scenario: New puzzle mid-game removes highlights and the marker

- **GIVEN** a board with cells that have `cell-violation` because of the player's entries, and a hint-filled cell with `cell-hinted`
- **WHEN** the player presses the new puzzle button and then `[data-confirm="yes"]`
- **THEN** the cells of the new board carry `cell-violation` only where the rule checker reports a violation for the new puzzle's givens, and no cell has `cell-hinted`

#### Scenario: Each press uses a new seed

- **GIVEN** an injected seed source returning 1, then 2, then 3
- **WHEN** the page is mounted and the new puzzle button is pressed twice (the boards have no entries)
- **THEN** the boards were generated from seeds 1, 2 and 3 in this order

### Requirement: Reset button

The page SHALL offer a button `[data-action="reset"]` labelled «Скинути» (NFR-5). When the board has player entries, pressing it SHALL first ask for confirmation (FR-67) and reset only after «Так, почати»; on an untouched board it SHALL act at once, with no dialog, and change no cell text, no class and no message (FR-58). Resetting SHALL set every non-given cell to empty, including cells filled by a hint, keep every given cell's text and `data-given` value, keep the current size (any of 4, 6 and 8) in `[data-board]`'s `data-size` and in the size control (`aria-checked` unchanged), remove every `cell-violation` class that does not come from the givens themselves (the highlights are recomputed for the reset board), empty `[data-message="hint"]` and `[data-message="win"]`, remove `cell-hinted` (FR-66), and keep the board editable. Reset SHALL NOT call the seed source or the generator. It works after a win (the solved board has entries, so the confirmation is asked, A-29). Reset is size-independent: the scenarios that touch the board are run for each N in the table below, each with a fixture puzzle of size N. Undo and restoring a saved state are not part of reset (FR-47 and FR-46 are Future).

| N |
|---|
| 4 |
| 6 |
| 8 |

Traces: FR-58, FR-67, FR-66, NFR-5

#### Scenario: Reset empties player cells and keeps givens and size

- **GIVEN** a mounted page with a fixture puzzle of size N, and the player has clicked several non-given cells and pressed the hint button once so that a hint filled a cell
- **WHEN** the player presses `[data-action="reset"]` and then `[data-confirm="yes"]`
- **THEN** every cell with `data-given="false"` shows empty text, and every cell with `data-given="true"` shows the same text and the same `data-given` value as before
- **AND** `[data-board]` has `data-size` equal to N, `aria-checked="true"` is still on the button of size N only, and no cell has `cell-hinted`

#### Scenario: Reset clears highlights and the hint message

- **GIVEN** a mounted page with a fixture puzzle of size N where at least one cell has the class `cell-violation` because of the player's entries (the givens alone report no violation), and `[data-message="hint"]` shows a sentence
- **WHEN** the player presses `[data-action="reset"]` and then `[data-confirm="yes"]`
- **THEN** no cell has the class `cell-violation` and `[data-message="hint"]` has empty text content

#### Scenario: Reset after a win

- **GIVEN** a mounted page with a fixture puzzle of size N whose board the player has solved, so that `[data-message="win"]` shows the win text
- **WHEN** the player presses `[data-action="reset"]`, then `[data-confirm="yes"]`, and then clicks a non-given cell once
- **THEN** after the confirmation `[data-message="win"]` has empty text content
- **AND** after the click that cell shows «0»

#### Scenario: Reset takes no seed and calls no generator

- **GIVEN** a mounted page with a fixture puzzle of size N, an injected seed source and an injected generator that count their calls, with the counts read after mount
- **WHEN** the player presses `[data-action="reset"]` on the untouched board, then makes an entry and presses `[data-action="reset"]` and `[data-confirm="yes"]`, and then repeats the entry, the press and the confirmation once more
- **THEN** after each step the seed-source call count and the generator call count equal the counts read after mount

#### Scenario: Reset on an untouched board changes nothing and asks nothing

- **GIVEN** a mounted page with a fixture puzzle of size N and no player action, with the text and class list of every cell and the text of both message regions recorded
- **WHEN** the player presses `[data-action="reset"]`
- **THEN** every cell has the same text and the same class list as recorded, and both message regions have the same text as recorded
- **AND** `showModal` was never called

### Requirement: Seed is chosen outside the engine, injectable and not shown

The page SHALL obtain the seed for each puzzle from a seed source outside `src/engine/`, calling it exactly once for each generation attempt (the mount, each performed press of the new puzzle button and each performed change to another size, including an attempt whose generator call throws), and at no other time: never for a press of the size already shown (FR-73), never for a requested action that the player cancelled (FR-67) and never for reset. It SHALL accept an injected seed source (contract in the DOM contract section) so tests are deterministic, and MUST NOT display the seed anywhere on the page, including in locale-formatted or separator-split form. When no seed source is injected, the default source SHALL give a different seed on each call (no two consecutive calls return the same seed) and every seed it returns SHALL be an integer from 0 to 2^31 - 1 inclusive. That range is the seed domain pinned by FR-51 and A-25.

Traces: FR-31, FR-42, FR-43, FR-51, FR-67, FR-73

#### Scenario: Injected seed gives a reproducible page

- **GIVEN** two pages mounted with seed sources that both return 42, using the real engine generator
- **WHEN** both have rendered
- **THEN** their cells have identical `data-given` values and identical text

#### Scenario: Default seed source gives new seeds in its domain

- **GIVEN** the page is mounted without an injected seed source and with an injected `generate` spy that records each seed and returns a fixture puzzle
- **WHEN** the new puzzle button is pressed 9 times (the boards have no entries), so the spy has recorded 10 seeds in all
- **THEN** every recorded seed is an integer from 0 to 2147483647 inclusive
- **AND** no two consecutive recorded seeds are equal (so a constant default source such as always 1 fails)
- **AND** no error is thrown

#### Scenario: Default seed source with the real generator

- **GIVEN** the page is mounted without an injected seed source and without an injected `generate`
- **WHEN** the page has rendered
- **THEN** a 6×6 board is rendered and no error is thrown

#### Scenario: Seed is not shown

- **GIVEN** the page is mounted with a seed source returning 987654
- **WHEN** the test inspects every text node under the page root, `document.title`, and every attribute value of every element in the root, each as a separate string
- **THEN** none of those strings contains `987654`, none contains `Intl.NumberFormat('uk-UA').format(987654)`, and none matches `/9\D?8\D?7\D?6\D?5\D?4/` (this covers `987 654` with a space, NBSP or narrow NBSP, `987,654` and `987.654`)

#### Scenario: Seed calls follow the puzzles generated

- **GIVEN** a counting seed source returning 1, 2, 3 and so on, and a `generate` spy
- **WHEN** the page is mounted, the new puzzle button is pressed once, the player presses «Поле 4×4», presses «Поле 4×4» again (the size already shown), and presses «Поле 8×8» (every board has no entries)
- **THEN** the seed source was called exactly four times and the spy recorded the seeds 1, 2, 3 and 4 in this order, paired with the sizes 6, 6, 4 and 8

#### Scenario: A cancelled or no-op action takes no seed

- **GIVEN** a counting seed source and a `generate` spy, and a mounted board with player entries, with the counts read now
- **WHEN** the player presses «Нова головоломка» and then `[data-confirm="no"]`, presses «Поле 8×8» and then `[data-confirm="no"]`, presses «Скинути» and then `[data-confirm="yes"]`, and presses the size button of the size shown
- **THEN** the seed-source call count and the generator call count equal the counts read now
