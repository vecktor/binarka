## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Hinted cell marker

The cell that the hint button filled SHALL carry the class `cell-hinted` until the next board change, and at most one cell SHALL carry it at any time (FR-66). The marker SHALL be removed by any later board change: a click on a non-given cell (including the hinted cell itself), a hint that fills another cell (the marker then moves to that new cell), «Нова головоломка», a size change and «Скинути». The marker SHALL NOT be removed by an action that changes no cell: a click on a given cell (FR-33), a hint that fills no cell (FR-25, FR-26), opening or closing the rules panel (FR-57), a failed generation that keeps the previous board (FR-43), a cancelled confirmation (FR-67) and a press of the already selected size (FR-73). An action that needs confirmation (FR-67) removes the marker when it is performed, not when it is requested. A given cell SHALL never carry the marker, and no cell carries it at mount. Which cue the marker draws (a cue that is not colour alone) is rendering and is covered by the held NFR-11 and NFR-14, see `docs/requirements-held.md`; this requirement pins the class only.

#### Scenario: No cell carries the marker at mount

- **GIVEN** the page has just been mounted with a fixture puzzle that has givens
- **WHEN** the test reads every `[data-cell]`
- **THEN** no cell has the class `cell-hinted`
- **AND** after a hint press on that page no cell with `data-given="true"` has the class `cell-hinted`

#### Scenario: A second hint moves the marker

- **GIVEN** a fixture puzzle on which a first press of the hint button fills cell X, and a second press fills another cell Y (the first fill breaks no rule)
- **WHEN** the player presses `[data-action="hint"]` twice
- **THEN** after the first press exactly one cell, X, has the class `cell-hinted`
- **AND** after the second press exactly one cell, Y, has it and X no longer has it

#### Scenario: Later board changes remove the marker

- **GIVEN** a fixture puzzle on which the hint button has filled cell X, so X carries `cell-hinted`
- **WHEN** the player does each of the actions in this table, each from a freshly prepared page

| Action |
|--------|
| clicks a non-given cell other than X |
| clicks X itself |
| presses «Нова головоломка» |
| changes the size to 4 (one run) or to 8 (one run), the injected generator returning a fixture of that size |
| presses «Скинути» |

- **THEN** after each action no cell of the board shown has the class `cell-hinted`

#### Scenario: Actions that change no cell keep the marker

- **GIVEN** a fixture puzzle with at least one given cell, on which the hint button has filled cell X, so X carries `cell-hinted`
- **WHEN** the player does each of the actions in this table, each from a freshly prepared page

| Action |
|--------|
| clicks a given cell (once, and again twice) |
| presses «Підказка» on a board where the hint engine returns no cell (the board breaks a rule, reachable only when the hint's own fill broke one, since a click on a non-given cell removes the marker; or no rule applies) |
| clicks `[data-action="rules"]` and then the close button «Зрозуміло» |

- **THEN** after each action exactly one cell has the class `cell-hinted`, it is X, and X still shows the digit the hint wrote

#### Scenario: A failed generation keeps the marker

- **GIVEN** a 6x6 fixture board on which a hint filled cell X, and an injected `generate` that throws for size 8
- **WHEN** the player changes the size to 8
- **THEN** `[data-board]` keeps `data-size="6"` and the same texts, and X still has the class `cell-hinted`

#### Scenario: A hint that wins keeps the marker on the filled cell

- **GIVEN** a fixture puzzle with exactly one cell empty, every other cell holding the solution digit, and the hint engine targeting that cell
- **WHEN** the player presses the hint button
- **THEN** `[data-message="win"]` shows the win message (see «Win message when solved»)
- **AND** exactly one cell has the class `cell-hinted`, the filled one

#### Scenario: Two mounts are independent

- **GIVEN** two pages mounted on two roots, a hint pressed on the first
- **WHEN** the test reads the second page
- **THEN** no cell of the second page has the class `cell-hinted`

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Hint button fills one cell

The page SHALL, when the hint button is pressed and the hint engine returns a target cell, write the engine's value into exactly that cell and into no other cell, and SHALL give that cell the class `cell-hinted` (FR-39, FR-66). A hint-filled cell SHALL be an ordinary player cell: `data-given="false"`, no `cell-given` class, and it can be changed by clicking (the click removes `cell-hinted`, see «Hinted cell marker»).

Traces: FR-39, FR-66

#### Scenario: Hint fills the targeted cell

- **GIVEN** a rendered board on which the hint engine returns a target cell and value
- **WHEN** the player presses `[data-action="hint"]`
- **THEN** the cell with `data-row` = row + 1 and `data-col` = col + 1 (the engine's 0-based `row` and `col`) shows that value
- **AND** every other cell has the same text as before the press

#### Scenario: The filled cell carries the marker

- **GIVEN** a rendered board on which the hint engine returns a target cell and value
- **WHEN** the player presses `[data-action="hint"]`
- **THEN** the target cell has the class `cell-hinted`, `data-given="false"` and no `cell-given` class
- **AND** no other cell has the class `cell-hinted`

#### Scenario: Zero-based target maps to the one-based cell

- **GIVEN** a fixture puzzle whose only given cells are 0 at `data-row` 3 with `data-col` 1 and 2, so that the hint engine returns `{ kind: 'fill', row: 2, col: 2, value: 1, rule: 'pair' }` (row 3 column 3 in the page's numbering)
- **WHEN** the player presses `[data-action="hint"]`
- **THEN** the cell with `data-row="3"` and `data-col="3"` shows `1` and has the class `cell-hinted`
- **AND** the cell with `data-row="2"` and `data-col="2"` is unchanged

#### Scenario: Count rule fills only one cell

- **GIVEN** a board on which no pair rule and no sandwich rule applies anywhere, the board breaks no rule, and the hint engine's target is a cell of a line L through the count rule, where several cells of L are empty
- **WHEN** the player presses the hint button once
- **THEN** exactly one cell on the whole board changed text, it is the hint engine's target, and every other empty cell of L is still empty
- **AND** only that cell has the class `cell-hinted`

#### Scenario: Hint-filled cell stays editable

- **GIVEN** a cell just filled by the hint button
- **WHEN** the player clicks it
- **THEN** its text follows the cycle for player cells and `data-given` stays `false`
- **AND** it no longer has the class `cell-hinted`

#### Scenario: No fill when the hint engine has no target

- **GIVEN** a board on which the hint engine returns `kind` 'none' or 'broken' (no target cell)
- **WHEN** the player presses the hint button
- **THEN** every cell has the same text as before the press, and no cell gains the class `cell-hinted`
